# Apple SHORTCUTS: currencyExchange
An Apple shortcuts command that allows to convert from one currency exchange to another: the code included here converts YEN into EUROs - but it can be update very easily manually from the shortcut editor.

To initiate, first download the [Apple Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334), then download the [currencyExchange shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/33f46ade350f44ae86bee9a13c9a4212). Feel free to rename the shortcut (_i.e._ it's current name is 'YEN to EURO') to a title of your preference.

The code above is in Italian as that's my phone's default language - but it works in any language. The lines that handle .json information extraction from the _**wise.com**_ links can be modified to use different currencies.
